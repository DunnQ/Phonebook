*Phonebook program*
This project simulates a Phonebook-in which a user can enter contacts and store them within a list of people. 
It can retrieve a contact from the list of contacts for you and it can also display the entire list of contacts 
within the phonebook. The list of contacts is stored within a text file. 

The second class "GUIPBOOK" is a graphical interface that displays a window in which you can add contacts, find them
or display them all. 

Screenshots of the GUI are also provided in the repository of project files (Phonebook).
